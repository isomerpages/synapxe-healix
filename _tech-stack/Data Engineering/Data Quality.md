<h1>Data Quality</h1>
<p><strong>High data quality</strong> is essential in healthcare for effective
decision-making, as it ensures that the information used is reliable and
can lead to better insights and patient outcomes. It also boosts operational
efficiency within healthcare settings by reducing the time and resources
spent on data correction and reconciliation, allowing healthcare providers
to focus on delivering quality care to patients. In addition, it plays
a significant role in risk management, as reliable data is essential for
identifying and mitigating risks effectively. Maintaining high data quality
is vital for the overall success and sustainability of healthcare organizations.</p>
