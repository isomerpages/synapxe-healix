<h1>File Transfer</h1>
<p><strong>File Transfer</strong> capabilities enable the secure, reliable
movement of data between systems, both within an organisation and with
external partners. This functionality ensures that critical data can be
accessed, shared, and synchronised across platforms while maintaining stringent
security standards. By supporting multiple transfer protocols, file transfer
solutions allow organisations to work with varied data sources, simplify
integration, and facilitate smooth data exchanges.</p>
<h2>Tool: AWS Transfer Family</h2>

secure file transfer capabilities, making it easy to move files in and
out of AWS without needing to manage infrastructure or handle security
updates. It supports popular transfer protocols, making it compatible with
existing file transfer systems while leveraging the security and scalability
of AWS.</p>
