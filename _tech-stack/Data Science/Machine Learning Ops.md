<h1>Machine Learning Ops (MLOps)</h1>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)</strong> is all about bridging
the gap between data science and production. It brings together the agility
of DevOps with the complexity of machine learning to ensure models are
not only built but continuously deployed, monitored, and optimised at scale.
With MLOps, data scientists and operations teams can collaborate more effectively,
automating workflows, tracking model performance, and tackling issues like
model drift.</p>
<h2>Tool: DataRobot</h2>
<p>DataRobot is a powerful MLOps platform that simplifies the process of
building, deploying, and managing machine learning models at scale by harnessing
the power of AI. Designed for both technical and non-technical users, it
automates the entire machine learning lifecycle. By leveraging advanced
algorithms and a wide array of pre-built models, DataRobot accelerates
the development of AI solutions, allowing organizations to unlock insights
from their data faster and more efficiently.</p>
