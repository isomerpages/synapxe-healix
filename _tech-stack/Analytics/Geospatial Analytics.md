<h1>Geospatial Analytics</h1>
<p><strong>Geospatial Analytics</strong> leverages spatial data to uncover
patterns, trends and insights related to geography and location. By integrating
data from multiple sources, it enables organisations to analyse geographic
relationships, make data-driven decisions, and visualise complex scenarios
on maps. This approach goes beyond traditional analysis by adding spatial
dimensions, empowering businesses and governments to plan more effectively,
optimise operations, and monitor real-time events.</p>
<h2>Tool: ArcGIS</h2>
<p><strong>ArcGIS</strong> is a powerful geospatial analytics platform that
enables users to create, analyse, and share location-based insights through
interactive maps and dashboards. It simplifies spatial analytics, allowing
users to integrate various datasets, automate workflows, and build interactive
web apps - all without the need for advanced technical skills. ArcGIS supports
everything from basic mapping to advanced geospatial analytics and real-time
monitoring.</p>
