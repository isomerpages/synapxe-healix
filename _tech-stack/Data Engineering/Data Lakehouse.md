<h1>Data Lakehouse Architecture</h1>
<p>A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines
the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data
management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business
intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.</p>
<h2>Tool: Databricks</h2>
<p>Databricks is built on lakehouse architecture, which combines the best
elements of data lakes and data warehouses to help reduce costs and deliver
on data and AI initiatives faster. Built on open source and open standards,
a lakehouse simplifies the data estate by eliminating the silos that historically
complicate data and AI.</p>
