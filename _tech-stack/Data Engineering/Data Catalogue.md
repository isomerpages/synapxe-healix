<h1>Data Catalogue</h1>
<p>A <strong>data catalogue</strong> is a comprehensive inventory of data assets
within an organization. It serves as a centralized repository that allows
users to discover, understand, and manage data resources effectively. By
providing metadata, descriptions, and usage guidelines, a data catalogue
enhances data governance, promotes data sharing, and facilitates data-driven
decision-making.</p>
