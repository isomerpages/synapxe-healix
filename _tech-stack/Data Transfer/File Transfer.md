<h1>File Transfer</h1>
<p><strong>File Transfer</strong> capabilities enable the secure, reliable
movement of data between systems, both within an organisation and with
external partners. This functionality ensures that critical data can be
accessed, shared, and synchronised across platforms while maintaining stringent
security standards. By supporting multiple transfer protocols, file transfer
solutions allow organisations to work with varied data sources, simplify
integration, and facilitate smooth data exchanges.</p>
