<h1>Data Pipeline</h1>
<p>A <strong>data pipeline</strong> is a series of data processing steps that
involve the collection, transformation, and storage of data from various
sources to a destination, such as a data warehouse or data lake. It automates
the flow of data, ensuring that it is efficiently processed and made available
for analysis and reporting. Data pipelines can handle batch or real-time
data processing, enabling organizations to derive insights and make data-driven
decisions quickly.</p>
